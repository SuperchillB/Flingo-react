# Flingo (under construction)

---

### Context & description

Flingo is a flashcard app focused essentially on language learning.

After years of frustration with AnkiApp's poorly maintained web app and UI/UX limitations, I've decided to build an application to improve my learning of both Greek and Korean.

Also, as a Vue.js developer, this was finally an excuse for me to get my feet wet with the React ecosystem and play around with some of its latest features in a medium-sized project.

### Current tech specs:

- Built with React
- State management: Context API + useReducer hook
- Bundler: Parcel.js
- DB: json-server
